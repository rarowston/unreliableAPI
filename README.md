This is the Unrelaible API project that was used to demonstrate HTTP resilience at the Adelaide .NET User Group https://www.meetup.com/adelaide-dotnet/events/298685906/

This is only a supporting repository to demonstrate the new http resilience features. 

The main repo with the code for the demo is at https://github.com/rarowston/net8speedrun
